"""Spec-driven evaluation scoring for agent outputs.

Reads an evaluation spec (e.g. ``agents/<name>/eval_spec/eval_spec.json``) produced by ``setup.py``
and scores agent outputs dynamically based on the configured field types,
weights, and tolerances.

Supports four scoring layers:
1. **Mechanical** — deterministic field-level matching (enum, number, text, boolean)
2. **LLM-as-Judge** — semantic quality assessment via a strong model
3. **Tool Usage** — checks tool call completeness, argument quality, and data chaining
4. **Type Correctness** — penalizes outputs with wrong field types
