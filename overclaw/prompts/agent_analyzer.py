ANALYSIS_PROMPT = """\
You are analyzing a Python AI agent to understand its input/output contract, \
tool orchestration, and propose evaluation criteria.

Agent source code:
{agent_code_section}

The agent's entry function is `{entrypoint_fn}`. The input schema MUST be derived
from this function's **parameter list** — each parameter becomes a field in
`input_schema`. Do NOT infer inputs from the UI layer, internal helper functions,
or Streamlit widgets. Only the parameters of `{entrypoint_fn}()` matter.

CRITICAL: The runner calls the agent via `{entrypoint_fn}(**input_dict)` when
the function has multiple parameters. This means the `input_schema` field names
MUST exactly match the function's parameter names, and test-case inputs will
use these names as dict keys. Getting this wrong causes runtime crashes.

The `output_schema` describes what the agent RETURNS — this may be a structured
JSON object (dict with typed fields) or a plain string/markdown. Derive the
output structure from the function's return type and actual return statements
in the code.

Return a JSON object with this exact structure:

}}

Rules for output_schema:
- Use "enum" for fields with a known set of valid string values. Include ALL valid \
values in "values".
- Use "number" for numeric fields. Include the expected range in "range".
- Use "text" for free-form string fields. Omit "values" and "range".
- Use "boolean" for true/false fields. Omit "values" and "range".

Rules for proposed_criteria:
- Set "importance" to "critical" for primary output fields, "important" for secondary, \
"minor" for supplementary.
- For enum fields: set "partial_credit" to true if a valid-but-wrong value still shows \
the agent is working.
- For number fields: set "tolerance" to a reasonable margin of error.
- For text fields: set "eval_mode" to "non_empty" if presence matters, "skip" if \
informational.

Rules for tool_analysis:
- Examine each tool's parameter definitions. If a parameter accepts enum-like values \
(e.g., company_size should be one of a fixed set), list them in param_constraints.
- Look for data dependencies between tools. If tool B needs output from tool A as an \
argument, list it in dependencies.
- Note if tool descriptions are vague or missing important constraints.
- List ALL tools that should be called for a typical input in expected_tools.

Rules for consistency_rules:
- Identify pairs of output fields that should logically correlate. For example, if \
there's a numeric score and a categorical field, a high score should align with the \
"best" category value. List the FIRST value in enum "values" as the highest/best.
- Set penalty proportional to how egregious the inconsistency would be.

Rules for optimizable_elements vs fixed_elements:
- optimizable_elements: Things the optimizer CAN change to improve performance.
  This MUST include:
  * System prompt / instructions
  * Tool definitions (descriptions, parameter schemas) — NOT their implementations
  * Input formatting functions (e.g., format_input)
  * Agent orchestration logic (the `{entrypoint_fn}()` entry function — tool call ordering, \
post-processing, retry logic, validation steps)
  * Model selection
- fixed_elements: Things that MUST NOT change because they are external \
dependencies or core infrastructure.
  * Tool IMPLEMENTATIONS (the actual Python functions that tools call)
  * Data sources / databases
  * Output parsing logic
  * Import structure and tracing integration
- The `{entrypoint_fn}()` entry function (or equivalent orchestration) should be listed in \
optimizable_elements with a note about what aspects can be changed (e.g., \
"{entrypoint_fn} — agent orchestration: tool call ordering, post-processing, validation").

Return ONLY the JSON object. No markdown fences, no commentary.
