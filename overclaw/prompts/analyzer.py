The following diagnosis describes what is wrong and what changes to make:

```json

## Constraints

- The entry function `{entrypoint_fn}` MUST remain callable with its current signature.
- Do NOT change any evaluation infrastructure, only the agent's logic.
- Do NOT hardcode responses for specific test inputs or patterns.
- Do NOT add post-processing that recomputes numeric output fields using a
  formula (e.g., value = avg_price * sqft) and overwrites the LLM's output.
  The LLM often produces correct values through judgment (anchoring on
  assessed values, adjusting for conditions, etc.). A mechanical formula will

## Task

1. Start by reading the entry file and any supporting files relevant to the

2. Apply the changes described in the diagnosis.
3. **Critically**: check whether your changes require corresponding updates in
   other files (updated imports, changed function signatures, new helpers, etc.).
4. If the diagnosis mentions tool implementation issues, find and fix the actual
   tool functions — they may be in supporting modules, not just the entry file.
5. If adding a helper function would be cleaner than inline logic, create it in
   the appropriate module.
6. Verify each edit is correct before moving on.

## System Prompt Metrics

Current SYSTEM_PROMPT size: **{prompt_char_count}** characters, **{prompt_line_count}** lines.

## Critical Rules

1. **ANTI-OVERFITTING (MOST IMPORTANT)** — Your changes will be tested on cases \
you CANNOT see. The test cases below are only a SUBSET of the full evaluation set.
   - Do NOT hardcode responses for specific test inputs or patterns observed below.
   - Do NOT add hardcoded numeric thresholds, keyword lists, or regex patterns \
derived from the test data.
   - Post-processing for validation/normalization (enum enforcement, type coercion, \
empty-field defaults) is fine. Post-processing that SUBSTITUTES hardcoded decisions \
for the LLM's analysis (e.g., "if X then set field to Y") is overfitting.

2. **NO EVALUATION GAMING (CRITICAL)** — Do NOT game the evaluation system:
   - Do NOT fabricate or inject synthetic tool calls outside the agent's loop.
   - Do NOT inject synthetic "user" or "assistant" messages to trick scoring.
   - Do NOT add extra LLM calls solely to "re-score" or "re-evaluate" \
after the main loop.
   - Do NOT pre-call tools before the LLM loop and stitch results into the \
conversation to bypass the agent's natural decision-making.
   However, you ARE encouraged to make genuine structural improvements:
   - Adding helper functions for data processing, validation, and transformation.
   - Improving tool implementation logic in supporting modules.
   - Adding pre-processing that enriches input data before the LLM sees it.
   - Adding post-processing that validates and normalizes output structure.
   - Improving error handling and retry logic.

3. **NO DETERMINISTIC OVERRIDE OF LLM OUTPUT (CRITICAL)** — Do NOT add \
post-processing that recomputes numeric output fields using a formula \
(e.g., computing estimated_value = avg_comp_price * sqft) and unconditionally \
overwriting the LLM's output. The LLM often produces correct values through \
judgment — anchoring on assessed values, adjusting for property condition, \
market context, etc. A mechanical formula will destroy those correct outputs. \
Instead, improve the **system prompt instructions** to guide the LLM toward \
better reasoning. Post-processing for **validation** (range checks, ordering \
enforcement, type coercion) is fine — post-processing that **substitutes a \
formula for the LLM's analysis** is harmful.

4. **PROMPT BLOAT** — The system prompt is already {prompt_char_count} chars. \
If the system prompt has grown significantly from the original, consider \
SIMPLIFYING it rather than piling on more rules. Prompt changes are fine when \
they add genuinely missing instructions, but avoid case-specific decision rules.

5. **CHANGE PRIORITY** — Consider changes across the full codebase. Combine \
changes across multiple targets when they reinforce each other:
   a. **Tool descriptions** — improve parameter descriptions, add constraints, \
clarify expected values.
   b. **Tool implementation** — fix bugs or improve logic in tool functions \
(these may live in supporting modules, not the entry file).
   c. **format_input** — restructure how input data is presented to the LLM.
   d. **System prompt** — add or clarify instructions that help the LLM make \
better decisions. Avoid case-specific rules.
   e. **Agent logic** — improve orchestration, add validation, error handling, \
helper functions for data processing. Keep changes purposeful and general.
   f. **Helper modules** — add or modify utility functions in supporting files.
   g. **Model** — only if the current model clearly lacks capability.
   Prefer structural improvements (new functions, better processing pipelines) \
over adding conditional branches.

6. **CONSERVATISM** — Suggest 1–4 targeted changes, not a complete rewrite.

7. **POLICY COMPLIANCE** — If an Agent Policy section is provided above, \
ensure proposed changes align with the stated decision rules and constraints. \
When diagnosing failures, check whether the agent violated policy rules — \
policy violations are high-priority fixes.

## Policy Constraints

## Rules
- Implement the changes listed in the diagnosis. You may include small \
supporting changes (e.g., a prompt clarification that complements a tool \
description fix) if they naturally follow from the diagnosis.
- The code must be syntactically valid and maintain the same interface.
- Do NOT hardcode responses for specific test inputs.
- Do NOT add deterministic post-processing that overrides the LLM's judgment \
with hardcoded decision logic (e.g., "if field == X then set other_field = Y"). \
Validation and normalization (enum enforcement, type coercion, field presence) is fine.
- Do NOT add post-processing that recomputes numeric fields using a formula \
(e.g., value = avg_price * sqft) and overwrites the LLM's output. The LLM \
often produces correct values through judgment; a mechanical formula will \
destroy those correct outputs. Improve prompts/instructions instead.
- Do NOT introduce hardcoded numeric thresholds or keyword pattern lists \
derived from specific test cases. Improvements must generalize to unseen inputs.
- If a change targets tool_description, modify the TOOLS list (e.g., improve \
parameter descriptions, add enum values, clarify usage).
- If a change targets format_input, modify the format_input() function.
- If a change targets tool_implementation, fix/improve the actual tool \
functions — these may live in supporting modules.
- If a change targets agent_logic, improve orchestration, add validation, \
error handling, or helper functions for data processing.
- If a change targets helper_module, add or modify utility functions in \
the appropriate supporting file.
- **NO EVALUATION GAMING** — Do NOT fabricate synthetic tool calls, inject \
synthetic messages to trick scoring, or add extra LLM calls solely \
to re-score. Genuine structural improvements (helper functions, better \
data processing, error handling) are encouraged.
- Keep the agent entry function named `{entrypoint_fn}` with a compatible signature \
(receives the input dict, returns a dict).
- Prefer structural improvements (new functions, better pipelines) over \
adding conditional branches.
