# Overmind

Overmind is two things in one package:

- **Tracing SDK** — drop-in observability for LLM agents. Decorate your code, get structured traces of every LLM call and tool invocation.
- **Inference client and CLI** — `overmind.Client` calls models you deployed on Overmind through the OpenAI-compatible API; the `overmind` command scans, syncs, and moves datasets and checkpoints.

**Documentation:** [Overmind guide](https://docs.overmindlab.ai/core/observability)

**Console:** [console.overmindlab.ai](https://console.overmindlab.ai/)

## Install

```bash
pip install overmind              # CLI (`overmind init`, sync, dataset/model files, optimiser)
pip install "overmind[tracing]"   # OpenTelemetry tracing (optional extra)
```

The default install is the command-line tool. Tracing is a separate extra so an
app that already pinned OpenTelemetry does not clash with ours.

```bash
uv tool install overmind
# or
pipx install overmind
```

## Quick start (local setup)

```bash
export OVERMIND_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
export OVERMIND_API_URL=https://api.overmindlab.ai   # or your console API host

pip install overmind
overmind init --ide cursor   # or claude | opencode | codex
overmind sync
```

The pasted account key is a bootstrap credential for the current shell only.
`init` installs the skill and prepares the selected IDE; `sync` creates the
project, stores its project-scoped key in `.overmind/credentials.toml`, and
updates the local MCP config. Reload the IDE once after the first sync.

Then in your coding harness:

```text
/overmind setup              # scan → capabilities → evals → overmind.toml → sync
```

```bash
overmind sync                # push overmind.toml, then pull reconciled ids
```

## Tracing

Needs `pip install "overmind[tracing]"`. Skip the extra if the app already
pinned OpenTelemetry — use the default install and fan-out (see the telemetry
skill). Wire up once at process start, then annotate the functions you want traced:

```python
import overmind

# Reads OVERMIND_API_KEY or the credential saved by overmind sync. Without a key this logs once
# per process, returns False, and every decorator below becomes a no-op —
# safe to ship.
overmind.init(
    service_name="my-agent",
    capability_id="<capability-uuid>",  # ingest maps traces by this id alone
    capability="Support Triage",  # display label; never resolves anything
    providers="auto",  # instrument every installed provider SDK
)  # (or name them: providers=["openai", "anthropic"])


@overmind.entry_point()  # run root (overmind.unit_kind = "run")
def run(request: dict) -> dict:
    overmind.intent(request["question"])  # what the user asked for
    answer = think(request)
    overmind.deliver(answer)  # terminal deliverable, auto-grounded
    return answer


@overmind.tool(ignore=("session",))  # tool evidence; session never captured
def search(query: str, session) -> list[dict]: ...


@overmind.observe(type="llm", capture="messages")  # full chat evidence
def call_model(messages: list[dict]) -> dict: ...
```

That is the whole integration: no init guards (everything no-ops without a key), no hand-rolled scrubbing (captured payloads redact secret-named keys and base64 blobs automatically, text is kept in full), and no evidence bookkeeping (`deliver()` grounds itself in the environment-provenance spans of the run — pass `grounded_by=[...]` to override). On `KeyboardInterrupt`/cancellation the entry-point span flushes before re-raising, so interrupted runs still land.

Decorators: `entry_point`, `workflow`, `tool`, `retrieval`, and the general `observe` (sync and async). All accept `capture=` (`"auto"` scrubbed args/result, `"none"`, `"messages"`), `ignore=` (argument names never captured), `format_input=` / `format_output=` hooks for custom payload shapes, `provenance=`, `unit=`, and `capability=`. `start_span(...)` is the context-manager companion; `set_tag`, `set_user`, `set_conversation_id`, and `capture_exception` annotate the current span Sentry-style.

The span name may be a callable receiving the call's arguments — for polymorphic dispatchers, where one function executes named actions and each invocation must emit its own tool span (`tool.name` follows the resolved name):

```python
class Tools:
    @overmind.tool(name=lambda self, action, **params: action.name)
    def act(self, action, **params):  # executes navigate / extract / done / ...
        ...
```

Spans declare evidence provenance for the platform's evaluation judges: tool and retrieval spans are tagged `overmind.provenance = "environment"` and LLM spans `"agent"` automatically; pass `provenance=` (`user` / `agent` / `environment` / `harness`) to override. `@entry_point` spans are run roots (`overmind.unit_kind = "run"`) — one per trace: a run declared inside an open trace resolves to `turn`. `unit="turn"` marks an independently scorable decision cycle — each turn becomes one scored task execution. Internal fan-out or iteration spans (parallel sub-queries, retries, loop bodies) must not declare `unit`; handoffs stamp their own `turn` automatically. A `function` span that starts a trace outside any run boundary is an orphan fragment and is not exported by default (`init(export_orphan_spans=True)` overrides).

The wire-level attribute contract is **pinned** in [`docs/tracing-attributes.md`](docs/tracing-attributes.md); nothing there is renamed. The telemetry skill (`skills/overmind/references/telemetry.md`) is the integrator's guide — run vs. turn, deliver placement, handoffs, and the anchor-decoration rule. When traces don't show up: `init(debug=True)` prints the endpoint, identity, enabled instrumentors, and export mode.

Multi-capability agents scope identity with `overmind.capability` — a context manager or decorator that stamps `overmind.capability.id` / `.name` on every span created inside and restores the outer identity on exit (`capability="..."` on any decorator is shorthand for the name-only scope):

```python
with overmind.capability("DOM Element Locator", id="..."):  # id optional
    locate(prompt)  # every span here belongs to the locator capability
```

Entering a different capability mid-trace is a handoff: the first span of the new scope is stamped `overmind.unit_kind = "turn"`, so the platform scores it as a new unit against that capability's evals. Only declared identities are stamped — nothing is auto-created. `overmind.task("behaviour-slug")` optionally pins spans to a declared Behaviour the same way.

Single-capability agents with multiple phases (graph nodes, debate rounds) carve a run into units with `task(..., unit="turn")` — the scope opens one turn span per behaviour per trace, re-entering the same key re-uses it even when a phase's activity is non-contiguous, and the span closes when the run ends:

```python
with overmind.task("investment-debate", unit="turn"):
    ...  # spans here nest under the behaviour's turn span
```

`overmind.run(...)` brackets a whole agent run in one scope — capability identity (args, else `OVERMIND_CAPABILITY_ID` / `OVERMIND_CAPABILITY_NAME`), the entry-point run span, intent, conversation id, tags, error status, and a flush on exit. The yielded handle delivers the terminal payload; call it inside the unit that produced it:

```python
with overmind.run(
    "trading-run", intent=f"Analyze {ticker}", conversation_id=f"{ticker}:{date}"
) as run:
    final_state = app.invoke(state)
    with overmind.task("portfolio-manager", unit="turn"):
        run.deliver(final_state["final_trade_decision"])
```

It is also a decorator (sync or async) for method entry points. Every parameter except `name` accepts a callable receiving the wrapped call's arguments, resolved per invocation, and the run-boundary span carries the function's `code.namespace` / `code.function.name` — one decoration covers both the run bracket and a scan-contract anchor. The return value is not auto-delivered; call `overmind.deliver()` inside the unit that produced it:

```python
class Agent:
    @overmind.run(
        intent=lambda self, *a, **k: self.task,
        conversation_id=lambda self, *a, **k: self.task_id,
    )
    async def run(self): ...
```

### LangChain / LangGraph

`pip install 'overmind[tracing]'`, then `providers=["langchain"]` mounts the OpenInference LangChain instrumentor (covers LangGraph): every chain, LLM and tool invocation gets a span with usable model/token/cost evidence. For the scoring semantics no instrumentor can know, `overmind.integrations.langgraph.bind` maps graph nodes to behaviour turn units — call it on the `StateGraph` after the `add_node` calls, before `compile()`:

```python
from overmind.integrations import langgraph as overmind_langgraph

overmind.init(providers=["openai", "langchain"], capability_id="<capability-uuid>")

workflow = build_state_graph()
overmind_langgraph.bind(
    workflow,
    # Default key per node: slugified node name ("Market Analyst" → "market-analyst").
    # Override where the scanned task map groups nodes differently; None opts a node out.
    behaviours={
        "Bull Researcher": "investment-debate",
        "Bear Researcher": "investment-debate",
        "Msg Clear Market": None,
    },
    deliver="Portfolio Manager",  # optional: this node's completion delivers its return value
)
app = workflow.compile()
```

Each node invocation runs inside `task(key, unit="turn")` (re-entrant phases share one unit) and function-backed nodes carry their `code.namespace` / `code.function.name` identity for contract anchoring.

## Skills

Use these from Cursor, Codex, or Claude Code to scaffold agents and operate
Overmind without leaving your coding environment. Skills live at the repo-root
[`skills/`](./skills/) directory so agent installers can pick them up from this
repository (e.g. `npx skills add overmind-core/overmind`).

```bash
overmind skills list --verbose
overmind skills sync overmind
overmind init --ide codex
```

`init` prepares each vendor's project-scoped MCP config, leaving any other
configured servers untouched. `sync` installs the final project key:

| `--ide`                  | MCP config           | Skill install      |
| ------------------------ | -------------------- | ------------------ |
| `cursor`                 | `.cursor/mcp.json`   | `.cursor/skills`   |
| `claude` / `claude_code` | `.mcp.json`          | `.claude/skills`   |
| `opencode`               | `opencode.json`      | `.opencode/skills` |
| `codex`                  | `.codex/config.toml` | `.agents/skills`   |

Claude Code reads project MCP servers from a root-level `.mcp.json`; it does not
read `.claude/mcp.json`. MCP configs containing the project key and
`.overmind/credentials.toml` are added to the clone-local Git exclude file and
written with owner-only permissions. Sync refuses to put a key in a tracked
config. Codex loads project configuration only for trusted repositories.

| Skill      | What it does                                                                                        |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Overmind` | Instrument tracing, inspect telemetry via MCP, upload datasets, run evals, fine-tune, and optimize. |

## Anonymous usage analytics

The SDK and CLI send anonymous product-analytics events to PostHog so we can
see how the package is adopted. Each CLI process emits one `cli.invoked` event
on exit (`command` = full redacted argv like `overmind skills list`,
`command_path` = nested path like `skills list`, exit code, duration), via
Typer's `call_on_close`. Library calls
emit `sdk_init` / `sdk_client_created` / `sdk_langgraph_bind`. When an API key
is available the SDK identifies the user once (cached under `~/.overmind/`) so
events join the same PostHog person as the Console.

This is **not** agent tracing: no prompts, span payloads, API keys, emails, or
dataset contents are included. Customer OTLP traces still go only to your
Overmind project via `overmind.init()`.

Opt out with any of:

```bash
export OVERMIND_ANALYTICS_ENABLED=false
# or
export DO_NOT_TRACK=1
```

Analytics is also off when `CI` is set in env.
