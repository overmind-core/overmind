"""Runtime eval declarations — the ``overmind.eval.*`` envelope.

Each public function emits a span event on the current span; the Overmind
platform parses these server-side, so event names and payload shapes are a
pinned wire contract (v1) — see ``docs/tracing-attributes.md`` §6.  All
functions no-op (with a debug log) when there is no recording span.
