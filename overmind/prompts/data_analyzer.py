You are a test data quality analyst. Analyze this dataset for an AI agent.

Analyze thoroughly:
1. **Coverage completeness**: Which input field values/combinations are
   well-represented? Which are missing or underrepresented?
2. **Difficulty distribution**: Classify each case as easy/medium/hard/edge_case.
   What's the distribution?
3. **Policy rule coverage**: For each domain rule and known edge case, is there
   at least one test case that exercises it? List uncovered rules.
4. **Enum field coverage**: For each enum output field, which values appear in
   expected_output? Which are missing?
5. **Number field boundary coverage**: For number fields with ranges, are
   boundary values (min, max, midpoint) tested?
6. **Potential quality issues**: Cases where expected_output seems inconsistent
   with the policy rules or with other fields.
