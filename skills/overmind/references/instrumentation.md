# Instrumenting an application with Overmind tracing

Wire an existing Python project into Overmind so every LLM call and traced
function is exported. Overmind is built on OpenTelemetry, so it can either
own the tracing pipeline or ride alongside a telemetry stack the project
already has.

The SDK surface is the `overmind` Python package (`init`, decorators,
`force_flush_traces`). This file may lag the package — prefer the code in
the installed SDK if they disagree.

Verify traces through Overmind MCP (`list_traces` / `get_trace`), not REST.
See [telemetry.md](telemetry.md).

## Workflow

```
- [ ] 0. Resolve the agent's identity — `get_agent` via MCP; copy its `id` (UUID) verbatim
- [ ] 1. Detect existing telemetry (OpenTelemetry, Traceloop, LangSmith, etc.)
- [ ] 2. Install the SDK and set env vars
- [ ] 3. Initialise — greenfield OR fan-out onto the existing provider, with the agent's identity (Step 3a/3b)
- [ ] 4. Auto-instrument the LLM providers in use
- [ ] 5. Add custom spans where useful
- [ ] 5a. Declare the task (`@overmind.task("<behaviour key>")` on the entry point) and emit the runtime eval envelope (intent / checkpoint / expect / eval_context / end_conversation)
- [ ] 5b. Scope everything to the ONE agent your task names — identity, files, verification
- [ ] 5c. Multi-agent repos: run the systematic one-at-a-time pass
- [ ] 6. Flush on shutdown, then run the app and audit traces via MCP
```

## What a good trace carries

Audit every integration — new or existing — against this baseline before
calling it done. Fetch a real trace with `list_traces` → `get_trace`
([telemetry.md](telemetry.md)); do not ask the user to describe the Console.

| Inputs and outputs      | The decorators (Step 5) capture call args and return values automatically; make sure the entry point and key steps are decorated so the trace shows what the agent saw and produced                                                                                            | A trace without I/O can't be debugged or turned into eval data                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| Behaviour anchor        | Every decorator auto-stamps `code.namespace` (`__module__`) + `code.function.name` (`__qualname__`) — the pair is the Behaviour Registry anchor the server binds spans to for task-execution scoring (`start_span` has no function to read, so no stamp)                       | Without the pair the server cannot bind spans to an anchor; executions land `unbound`                                                                                                                                                                   |

## Step 0 — Resolve the agent's identity

The authoritative source for agent identity is `get_agent` via MCP (see
[telemetry.md](telemetry.md)): it returns the agent's `id` (a UUID) and its
`flow` — the capability card with `agent_path`, `modes[*].entrypoint_fn`,
system prompt, and tool surface. Call it with the agent's name/slug before
writing any instrumentation. Copy the returned `id` verbatim — never invent,
shorten, re-format, or "fix" it, and never substitute another agent's id. If
the id is missing or does not look like a UUID, STOP and report instead of
guessing: a wrong id silently attributes every trace to the wrong agent.

Then map the agent to its tasks with `list_behaviours(agent)`: behaviour
keys, entry anchors, anchor sequence, terminal, and execution/unbound
counts. The key for each task is what you declare in Step 5a.

## Step 1 — Detect existing telemetry

Grep the project before writing any code. The result decides Step 3.

```bash
rg -n "set_tracer_provider|TracerProvider|opentelemetry|traceloop|Traceloop|langsmith|OTEL_EXPORTER" --glob '!**/.venv/**'
```

- **No matches** → greenfield path (Step 3a). `overmind.init()` creates and
  installs the provider.
- **A `TracerProvider` is already set** (OTel directly, Traceloop/OpenLLMetry,
  LangSmith's OTel bridge, etc.) → fan-out path (Step 3b). OpenTelemetry only
  honours the **first** `set_tracer_provider()` call and ignores later ones with
  a warning, so calling `overmind.init()` on top of an existing provider would
  silently attach nothing. Instead, add Overmind's exporter to the provider the
  project already owns.

## Step 2 — Install and configure

```bash
uv add overmind        # or: pip install overmind
```

Required environment variable (project API key — same one the MCP server
uses). Ask the user to set it in their shell or `.env`. Never ask them to
paste the key into chat.

```bash
export OVERMIND_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
```

Optional identity/config (all have env-var equivalents read by `init()`):

| Env var                 | Purpose                                          |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `OVERMIND_SERVICE_NAME` | Service name on the traces                       |
| `OVERMIND_AGENT_NAME`   | Human-readable agent name                        |
| `OVERMIND_AGENT_ID`     | Agent UUID (preferred over name once registered) |
| `OVERMIND_ENVIRONMENT`  | e.g. `production` (default `development`)        |
| `OVERMIND_API_URL`      | Override the trace endpoint base URL             |

## Step 3a — Greenfield init

Call once at process start, before the traced code runs:

```python
import overmind

overmind.init(
    service_name="my-agent",
    agent_id="<agent-uuid>",  # copy verbatim from get_agent — never invent
    agent_name="My Agent",  # this agent's constant display name
    providers=["openai", "anthropic"],  # auto-instrument these SDKs; see Step 4
)
```

`providers=[]` (empty list) enables every supported provider;
omitting `providers` enables none.

## Step 3b — Fan-out onto an existing telemetry provider

Keep the project's current telemetry untouched and add a second exporter that
ships the same spans to Overmind. This works because a `TracerProvider` can
hold many span processors — each exports independently.

```python
from opentelemetry import trace
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace import TracerProvider
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import BatchSpanProcessor
from opentelemetry.exporter.otlp.proto.http.trace_exporter import OTLPSpanExporter

import overmind
from overmind.tracing import (
    enable_tracing,
    get_api_settings,
    set_agent_id,
    set_agent_name,
)

api_key, base_url = get_api_settings()  # reads OVERMIND_API_KEY / OVERMIND_API_URL

provider = trace.get_tracer_provider()
if not isinstance(provider, TracerProvider):
    # Nothing real was installed yet — let Overmind own the pipeline instead.
    overmind.init(
        service_name="my-agent",
        agent_id="<agent-uuid>",  # copy verbatim from get_agent
        agent_name="My Agent",
        providers=["openai"],
    )
else:
    provider.add_span_processor(
        BatchSpanProcessor(
            OTLPSpanExporter(
                endpoint=f"{base_url}/api/v1/traces",
                headers={"X-Api-Key": api_key},
            )
        )
    )
    # Auto-instrument the LLM SDKs against the existing provider.
    enable_tracing(["openai", "anthropic"])
    # Fan-out path: identity is NOT stamped by an on-start processor, so stamp it
    # explicitly on the spans you decorate (Step 5) and via the context helpers.
    set_agent_id("<agent-uuid>")  # verbatim from get_agent
    set_agent_name("My Agent")
```

Notes:

- The project's existing backend keeps receiving spans; Overmind gets a copy.
- Overmind's server reads canonical `genai.*` usage attributes. Spans from
  third-party auto-instrumentors that only emit OTel `gen_ai.*` keys are
  bridged automatically **only when Overmind owns the provider**. On the
  fan-out path, prefer Overmind's own auto-instrumentation (`enable_tracing`)
  or the decorators in Step 5 so token/cost rollups populate.

## Step 4 — Auto-instrument LLM providers

Supported providers: `openai`, `anthropic`, `google`, `agno`. Each needs the
matching instrumentation package installed (bundled with `overmind`). Pass them
to `init(providers=[...])` (greenfield) or `enable_tracing([...])` (fan-out).
Instrumentation is idempotent and safe to call more than once.

## Step 5 — Add custom spans

Decorators (sync and async) — use the type that matches the code:

```python
@overmind.task(
    "behaviour-key"
)  # declared key from list_behaviours; the task span is the entry point
def run(payload: dict) -> dict: ...


@overmind.workflow()  # multi-step orchestration
def pipeline(): ...


@overmind.tool()  # a tool/function the agent can call
def search(query: str) -> list[dict]: ...


@overmind.retrieval()  # RAG / vector lookup
def fetch_docs(q: str): ...


@overmind.function()  # any other traced function
def score(x): ...
```

`@overmind.task("<behaviour key>")` (decorator, or the
`with overmind.task("<behaviour key>"):` context-manager form) opens the
task's `entry_point` unit span and stamps the declared key — copy the key
from `list_behaviours(agent)`. `name=` on any decorator (`function`, `tool`,
`workflow`, `retrieval`, `entry_point`, `task`) stamps `overmind.anchor.name` —
a rename-proof anchor identity that survives module/function moves; without
`name=` the qualname (`code.namespace` + `code.function.name`) stays the
default.

Context manager and current-span helpers:

```python
with overmind.start_span("rerank", span_type=overmind.SpanType.FUNCTION) as span:
    overmind.set_tag("candidate_count", len(candidates))

overmind.set_user("user-123", email="a@b.com")
overmind.set_conversation_id("conv-abc")  # groups spans into one session
overmind.set_agent_id("<agent-uuid>")  # verbatim from get_agent — never invented
overmind.set_agent_name("My Agent")  # keep constant for this agent

try:
    ...
except Exception as exc:
    overmind.capture_exception(exc)  # marks the span errored
    raise
```

`start_span` and the decorators use the ambient tracer, so they attach to
whichever provider is active — greenfield or fan-out.

**Minimum for a good trace.** The entry point alone is NOT enough. For every
function the agent's code path actually calls that is a meaningful step — a
tool the agent can invoke, a policy lookup, a retrieval, a scoring step —
decorate it with the matching type (`@tool`, `@retrieval`, `@function`,
`@workflow`). A trace whose spans are all `entry_point` is flat: it cannot
show which step failed or was slow. Rule of thumb: if the function has a name
a human would use to describe the agent's work ("search", "lookup_policy",
"rerank"), it should be a span.

## Step 5a — Runtime envelope: declare intent, milestones, expectations

Decorators make a trace *visible*; the runtime envelope makes it *scorable*.
First, bind the run to its task: decorate the task's entry point with
`@overmind.task("<behaviour key from list_behaviours>")` (or wrap it in
`with overmind.task("<behaviour key>"):`). The key is stamped on the
`entry_point` unit span, and the trace binds to that Behaviour by contract.
Then emit the envelope. Each call emits a pinned `overmind.eval.*` span
event (see the baseline
table). Exact signatures/semantics live in `overmind/evals.py` — read it if
in doubt. All five **no-op (debug log) when there is no recording span**, so
call them inside a decorated span:

```python
@overmind.entry_point()
def run(request: dict) -> dict:
    overmind.intent(
        request["user_message"]
    )  # grounds the judge; omit -> server falls back to the first user message
    overmind.eval_context(user_tier="premium", retries=3)  # facts for the judge

    overmind.expect(
        "contains", "USD", gate=True
    )  # hard fail: failure caps the execution score at 0
    overmind.expect("regex", r"\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}", id="date-format")
    overmind.expect("schema", {"type": "object", "required": ["amount"]}, scope="trace")
    overmind.expect("checkpoints", ["plan_formed", "payment_confirmed", "receipt_sent"])

    overmind.checkpoint("plan_formed")  # named milestone / turn boundary
    ...
    overmind.checkpoint("payment_confirmed")
    ...
    overmind.end_conversation()  # conversation-scope scoring; needs set_conversation_id / @conversation
```

Semantics:

- **`intent(text, *, source="declared")`** — declare what the user asked for
  this run; the platform grounds judge scoring in it. Declare it at every
  turn boundary in multi-turn agents. When undeclared, the server falls back
  to the first user message.
- **`checkpoint(name)`** — named trajectory milestone / turn boundary;
  `expect(..., kind="checkpoints")` can assert the expected ordered path.
- **`expect(kind, spec, *, id=None, scope="trace", gate=False)`** — runtime
  expectation. `kind` ∈ `contains | regex | schema | constraint | checkpoints`; `scope` ∈ `span | trace | conversation`. `id` auto-derives as
  a stable short hash of kind+spec when omitted (the platform dedupes /
  aggregates per expectation). `schema` takes a JSON schema object,
  `checkpoints` an ordered list of names, `constraint` natural-language text.
  `gate=True` makes a failure a hard fail that caps the execution's score at 0.
- **`eval_context(**facts)`** — runtime facts for the judge; values coerced
  like `set_tag`.
- **`end_conversation()`** — signal the conversation is complete; triggers
  conversation-scope scoring (requires a conversation id from
  `set_conversation_id` / `@conversation`).

### Where to instrument — anchor priority

`get_instrumentation_context(agent)` returns the agent's Behaviour anchors —
the `code.namespace` + `code.function.name` span-identity pairs the server
binds spans to — ranked `entry → discriminating → supplementary`. Each anchor
carries an `instrumented` bool, an `import_line`, a `verification_hint`
(tells you how to confirm the `code.namespace=…` / `code.function.name=…`
pair really arrives on the trace), and the context bundles `remaining` (the
anchors not yet instrumented) and `indistinguishable_pairs`.

Work `remaining` first, in priority order:

1. **entry** — the task's entry point(s); the spine of the execution row.
1. **discriminating** — steps that distinguish one execution/outcome from
   another (scoring-critical).
1. **supplementary** — supporting steps (nice-to-have structure).

Honour each anchor's `verification_hint` when instrumenting it, and resolve
`indistinguishable_pairs` — two anchors the trace cannot tell apart because
their spans stamp the same identity — by naming spans/functions so the
identities disambiguate.

### Declared keys vs the failsafe

A declared key makes the binding a contract: the trace always binds
(`declared`) even when the git sha is missing or unanalyzed. An unknown key
is flagged `declared_key_unknown` and falls through to structural matching —
never silently guessed.

Without a declared key the server structurally matches span identity against
the registry: scored matched/expected coverage-fraction, binds only when the
best beats the runner-up by ≥1.5×, and is file-path-joined (a bare `run` in
`entry.py` cannot suffix-collide with `app.b.run`). Ties and weak matches
stay `unbound_ambiguous`; a sole candidate still binds but with zero evidence
— flagged `bind_review` at confidence 0.0, never a silent overconfident bind.

So verification checks `attribution_verdict` / `binding_confidence`, not
just `binding_source`.

## Step 5b — Instrumenting ONE agent in a multi-agent repo

Most instrumentation tasks name **one specific agent**. Everything in this
skill is scoped to that agent:

- **Identity.** Stamp exactly the `agent_id` and `agent_name` from `get_agent`
  (Step 0). The `agent_id` is a UUID — copy it verbatim into `init(agent_id=)`,
  `set_agent_id()`, or `OVERMIND_AGENT_ID`. Never invent, shorten, re-format,
  or substitute another agent's id.
- **Scope.** Only touch the named agent's files (`agent_path`,
  `modes[*].entrypoint_fn`, its own tools and prompt). Do not edit sibling
  agents, and do not re-decorate code they own. Shared infrastructure (a
  common LLM client, a shared `core/` module) is usually fine to instrument
  once — leave its own identity alone and let this agent's identity ride on
  the spans that pass through it.
- **One identity per agent.** Other agents in the repo each have their own
  stable `agent_id`/`agent_name`. Distinct names across agents are correct;
  only a SINGLE agent's name changing between runs is a bug (it forks the
  agent).
- **Shared process.** If several agents run in one process (e.g. a FastAPI
  app with per-agent routers), do not rely on one global identity. Resource
  attrs are process-global — the first `init()` in a shared process pins
  them, so spans from sibling agents misattribute to that first agent. Stamp
  each agent's identity at the start of its own request path: the identity
  setters (`set_agent_id` / `set_agent_name`) are scoped to the current
  task/context, so calling them in each handler keeps that agent's spans
  attributed to it. Span-level stamps win over the stale resource identity on
  the server.
- **Verify per agent.** In Step 6, fetch traces filtered to THIS agent's UUID
  (`list_traces` with the agent filter, see [telemetry.md](telemetry.md)) and
  confirm they carry `overmind.agent.id` = the agent's UUID and its
  `agent_name`.

## Step 5c — Multi-agent repos: the systematic one-at-a-time pass

When the task covers every agent in a repo (or the repo as a whole), do NOT
try to instrument everything in one giant pass. Work ONE agent at a time,
end to end, in a strict loop — each pass has a small, focused context (one
agent's files + one UUID), a failure can't poison sibling agents, and every
agent ships *verified* instead of "hope it worked". A repo with 20 agents =
20 small successful passes, not one huge risky one.

The loop:

1. **Discover.** `list_agents` (MCP) — or the agents named in the task
   prompt. The work unit is N separate passes.
1. **Pick one agent.** Start with the first, and never start the next until
   the current one is done and verified.
1. **Fetch its card.** `get_agent` → its `id` (UUID) and capability card.
   Note `agent_path` / `modes[*].entrypoint_fn` — the exact files this agent
   owns.
1. **Instrument only that agent.** Follow Steps 0-5b scoped to THIS agent:
   touch only its files, stamp its UUID verbatim, leave sibling agents' code
   alone (shared infrastructure is fine to instrument once).
1. **Run + verify only that agent.** Run its entrypoint, flush, then fetch
   traces filtered to ITS UUID (Step 6). Audit against the baseline: the
   trace's `agent` equals this agent's UUID, `agent_name` constant, model +
   tokens + cost populated, inputs/outputs on the entry point, no secrets.
1. **Close it.** Fix gaps until this agent's trace clears. Then move to the
   next agent (back to step 2).

Only at the end, report each agent with its trace link.

## Step 6 — Flush on shutdown, then run and audit (required)

Batch export is async; flush before a short-lived process exits or spans are
lost:

```python
overmind.force_flush_traces()
```

Instrumentation isn't done when the code compiles. This is a loop you own as
the agent:

**a.** Run the instrumented path end-to-end so a real trace is sent.

**b.** Fetch it via Overmind MCP — [telemetry.md](telemetry.md):
`list_traces` (newest) → `get_trace` on that `trace_id`. Do not curl REST.
When your task names one agent in a multi-agent repo, fetch filtered to that
agent's UUID — never the repo-wide newest trace, which may belong to a
sibling agent.

**b2.** Task-execution-first audit — execution rows are the primary
observability row for trajectory instrumentation. `list_task_executions` on
that agent → `get_task_execution(id)` on the row:
`attribution_verdict` must be `bound_declared` or `bound_structurally`
(never an `unbound_*` verdict or `bound_low_conf` — that means the declared
key, code identity, or code path never matched the server's registry; fix
it, don't move on) and `binding_confidence` should be high; on
`get_task_execution` inspect `binding_provenance` (`rung`, `confidence`,
`margin`, `version_mismatch`), confirm `user_intent` is the declared intent
(or the expected first-user-message fallback), and that `success_score` /
`session_score` are populated. Then pull `behaviour_coverage` on the agent
to confirm every step evaluator got evidence and no `remaining` anchors are
still silent.

**c.** Audit the raw spans against the [baseline table](#what-a-good-trace-carries)
too — this is complementary to b2, not a replacement. On
the list row check `agent_id` (the agent's UUID, verbatim) and `agent_name`,
`model`, `total_tokens`, `total_cost`, and session grouping for multi-turn
apps; on the detail spans check `span_type` variety (not everything
`llm_call`, and not everything `entry_point`), inputs/outputs on the entry
point and key steps (`overmind.input.data` / `overmind.output.data` on span
attributes), and that no secrets appear in captured payloads. If the trace's
agent UUID differs from the card's, the identity stamp is wrong — fix it
before anything else.

**d.** Fix every gap, re-run, re-fetch. Repeat until the trace clears the
baseline. Then report what is traced.

If nothing shows up:

- Confirm `OVERMIND_API_KEY` is set in the running process.
- On the fan-out path, confirm the existing object really is an SDK
  `TracerProvider` (a no-op default won't accept processors) and that
  `force_flush_traces()` (or the app) ran long enough to export.
- Set `OVERMIND_STRICT_MODE=true` to make missing instrumentation packages
  raise instead of warn.
- Empty `list_traces` means ingest failed — fix instrumentation, don't poll
  REST.
